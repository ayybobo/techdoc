            Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) hold promise for the restoration of
            sensory and motor function and the treatment of neurological
            disorders, but clinical BMIs have not yet been widely adopted, in
            part because modest channel counts have limited their potential. In
            this white paper, we describe Neuralink’s first steps toward a
            scalable high-bandwidth BMI system. We have built arrays of small
            and flexible electrode “threads”, with as many as 3,072 electrodes
            per array distributed across 96 threads. We have also built a
            neurosurgical robot capable of inserting six threads (192
            electrodes) per minute. Each thread can be individually inserted
            into the brain with micron precision for:
            <li>Avoidance of surface vasculature</li>
            <li>Targeting specific brain regions</li>
            <br />
            The electrode array is packaged into a small implantable device that
            contains custom chips for low-power on-board amplification and
            digitization: the package for 3,072 channels occupies less than
            <code>(23 × 18.5 × 2)mm3</code>
            A single USB-C cable provides full-bandwidth data streaming from the
            device, recording from all channels simultaneously. This system has
            achieved a spiking yield of up to 85.5 % in chronically implanted
            electrodes. Neuralink’s approach to BMI has unprecedented packaging
            density and scalability in a clinically relevant package.

          <p>
            Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have the potential to help people
            with a wide range of clinical disorders. For example, researchers
            have demonstrated human neuroprosthetic control of computer cursors
            [1, 2, 3], robotic limbs [4, 5], and speech synthesizers [6] using
            no more than 256 electrodes. While these successes suggest that high
            fidelity information transfer between brains and machines is
            possible, development of BMI has been critically limited by the
            inability to record from large numbers of neurons. Noninvasive
            approaches can record the average of millions of neurons through the
            skull, but this signal is distorted and nonspecific [7, 8]. Invasive
            electrodes placed on the surface of the cortex can record useful
            signals, but they are limited in that they average the activity of
            thousands of neurons and cannot record signals deep in the brain
            [9]. Most BMI’s have used invasive techniques because the most
            precise readout of neural representations requires recording single
            action potentials from neurons in distributed, functionally-linked
            ensembles [10].
          </p>
          <p>
            Microelectrodes are the gold-standard technology for recording
            action potentials, but there has not been a clinically translatable
            microelectrode technology for large-scale recordings [11]. This
            would require a system with material properties that provide high
            biocompatibility, safety, and longevity. Moreover, this device would
            also need a practical surgical approach and high-density, low-power
            electronics to ultimately facilitate fully-implanted wireless
            operation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most devices for long-term neural recording are arrays of electrodes
            made from rigid metals or semiconductors [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
            18]. While rigid metal arrays facilitate penetrating the brain, the
            size, Young’s modulus and bending stiffness mismatches between stiff
            probes and brain tissue can drive immune responses that limit the
            function and longevity of these devices [19, 11]. Furthermore, the
            fixed geometry of these arrays constrains the populations of neurons
            that can be accessed, especially due to the presence of vasculature.
          </p>
          <p>
            An alternative approach is to use thin, flexible multi-electrode
            polymer probes [20, 21]. The smaller size and increased flexibility
            of these probes should offer greater biocompatibility. However, a
            drawback of this approach is that thin polymer probes are not stiff
            enough to directly insert into the brain; their insertion must be
            facilitated by stiffeners [22, 21], injection [23, 24] or other
            approaches [25], all of which are quite slow [26, 27]. To satisfy
            the functional requirements for a high-bandwidth BMI, while taking
            advantage of the properties of thin-film devices, we developed a
            robotic approach, where large numbers of fine and flexible polymer
            probes are efficiently and independently inserted across multiple
            brain regions [28].
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, we report Neuralink’s progress towards a flexible, scalable
            BMI that increases channel count by an order of magnitude over prior
            work. Our system has three main components:
            <li>Ultra-fine polymer probes</li>
            <li>A neurosurgical robot</li>
            <li>Custom high-density electronics</li>
            <br />
            We demonstrate the rapid implantation of 96 polymer threads, each
            thread with 32 electrodes, in a (4 × 7) mm2 area of brain for a
            total of 3,072 electrodes.
          </p>
          <p>
            We developed miniaturized custom electronics that allow us to stream
            full broadband electrophysiology data simultaneously from all these
            electrodes (section 5). We packaged this system for long-term
            implantation and developed custom online spike detection software
            that can detect action potentials with low latency. Together, this
            system serves as a state-of-the-art research platform and a first
            prototype towards a fully implantable human BMI.

          <p>
            We have developed a custom process to fabricate minimally displacive
            neural probes that employ a variety of biocompatible thin film
            materials. The main substrate and dielectric used in these probes is
            polyimide, which encapsulates a gold thin film trace. Each thin film
            array is composed of a “thread” area that features electrode
            contacts and traces and a “sensor” area where the thin film
            interfaces with custom chips that enable signal amplification and
            acquisition. A wafer-level microfabrication process enables
            high-throughput manufacturing of these devices. Ten thin film
            devices are patterned on a wafer, each with 3,072 electrode
            contacts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each array has 48 or 96 threads, each of those containing 32
            independent electrodes. Integrated chips are bonded to the contacts
            on the sensor area of the thin film using a flip-chip bonding
            process. One goal of this approach is to maintain a small thread
            cross-sectional area to minimize tissue displacement in the brain.
            To achieve this, while keeping channel count high, stepper
            lithography and other microfabrication techniques are used to form
            the metal film at sub-micron resolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have designed and manufactured over 20 different thread and
            electrode types into our arrays; two example designs are shown in
            panels A and B of fig. 1. We have fabricated threads ranging from 5
            to 50 µm in width that incorporate recording sites of several
            geometries (fig. 1). Thread thickness is nominally 4 to 6 µm, which
            includes up to three layers of insulation and two layers of
            conductor. Typical thread length is approximately 20 mm. To manage
            these long, thin threads prior to insertion, parylene-c is deposited
            onto the threads to form a film on which the threads remain attached
            until the surgical robot pulls them off. Each thread ends in a (16 ×
            50) µm2 loop to accommodate needle threading.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the individual gold electrode sites have small geometric
            surface areas (fig. 1C), we use surface modifications to lower the
            impedance for electrophysiology and increase the effective
            charge-carrying capacity of the interface (fig. 1D). Two such
            treatments that we have used are the electrically conductive polymer
            poly-ethylenedioxythiophene doped with polystyrene sulfonate
            (PEDOT:PSS) [29, 30] and iridium oxide (IrOx) [31, 32]. In bench-top
            testing we have achieved impedances of
            <code class="code-box">
              ± 4.68 kΩ (n="257" electrodes) and 56.46 ± 7.10 kΩ (n="588)"
            </code>
            for PEDOT:PSS and IrOx, respectively. The lower impedance of
            PEDOT:PSS is promising, however the long-term stability and
            biocompatibility of PEDOT:PSS is less well established than for
            IrOx. These techniques and processes can be improved and further
            extended to other types of conductive electrode materials and
            coatings.

            Thin-film polymers have previously been used for electrode probes
            [21], but their low bending stiffness complicates insertions.
            Neuralink has developed a robotic insertion approach for inserting
            flexible probes [28], allowing rapid and reliable insertion of large
            numbers of polymer probes targeted to avoid vasculature and record
            from dispersed brain regions. The robot’s insertion head is mounted
            on 10 µm globally accurate, 400 mm × 400 mm × 150 mm travel
            threeaxis stage, and holds a small, quick-swappable,
            “needle-pincher” assembly (fig. 2, fig. 3A).
          </p>
          <p>
            The needle is milled from 40 µm diameter tungsten-rhenium wire-stock
            electrochemically etched to 24 µm diameter along the inserted length
            (fig. 2A). The tip of the needle is designed both to hook onto
            insertion loops—for transporting and inserting individual
            threads—and to penetrate the meninges and brain tissue. The needle
            is driven by a linear motor allowing variable insertion speeds and
            rapid retraction acceleration (up to 30,000 mm s−2 ) to encourage
            separation of the probe from the needle. The pincher is a 50 µm
            tungsten wire bent at the tip and driven both axially and
            rotationally (fig. 2B). It serves as support for probes during
            transport and as a guide to ensure that threads are inserted along
            the needle path. Figure 4 shows a sequence of photographs of the
            insertion process into an agarose brain proxy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The inserter head also holds an imaging stack (fig. 3E–G) used for
            guiding the needle into the thread loop, insertion targeting, live
            insertion viewing, and insertion verification. In addition, the
            inserter head contains six independent light modules, each capable
            of independently illuminating with 405 nm, 525 nm and 650 nm or
            white light (fig. 3C). The 405 nm illumination excites fluorescence
            from polyimide and allows the optical stack and computer vision to
            reliably localize the (16 × 50) µm2 thread loop and execute
            sub-micron visual servoing to guide, illuminated by 650 nm the
            needle through it. Stereoscopic cameras, software based monocular
            extended depth of field calculations, and illumination with 525 nm
            light allow for precise estimation of the location of the cortical
            surface.
          </p>
          <p>
            The robot registers insertion sites to a common coordinate frame
            with landmarks on the skull, which, when combined with depth
            tracking, enables precise targeting of anatomically defined brain
            structures. An integrated custom software suite allows pre-selection
            of all insertion sites, enabling planning of insertion paths
            optimized to minimize tangling and strain on the threads. The
            planning feature highlights the ability to avoid vasculature during
            insertions, one of the key advantages of inserting electrodes
            individually. This is particularly important, since damage to the
            blood-brain barrier is thought to play a key role in the brain’s
            inflammatory response to foreign objects [33].
          </p>
          <p>
            The robot features an auto-insertion mode, which can insert up to 6
            threads (192 electrodes) per minute. While the entire insertion
            procedure can be automated, the surgeon retains full control, and if
            desired, can make manual microadjustments to the thread position
            before each insertion into the cortex. The neurosurgical robot is
            compatible with sterile shrouding, and has features to facilitate
            successful and rapid insertions such as automatic sterile ultrasonic
            cleaning of the needle. The needle pincher cartridge (NPC; fig. 2C)
            is the portion of the inserter head that makes direct contact with
            brain tissue and is a consumable that can be replaced mid-surgery in
            under a minute.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this system, we have demonstrated an average of
            <code>87.1 ± 12.6 %</code>
            (mean ± s.d.) insertion success rate over 19 surgeries. In this
            study, precise manual adjustments were made to avoid
            microvasculature on the cortical surface, slowing total insertion
            time from the fastest possible. Even with these adjustments, the
            total insertion time for this study averaged ∼45 min, for an
            approximate insertion rate of 29.6 electrodes per minute (fig. 6).
            Insertions were made in a (4 × 7) mm2 bilateral craniotomy with >300
            µm spacing between threads to maximize cortical coverage. This
            demonstrates that robotic insertion of thin polymer electrodes is an
            efficient and scalable approach for recording from large numbers of
            neurons in anatomically defined brain regions.

            Chronic recording from thousands of electrode sites presents
            significant electronics and packaging challenges. The density of
            recording channels necessitates placing the signal amplification and
            digitization stack within the array assembly, otherwise the cable
            and connector requirements would be prohibitive. This recording
            stack must amplify small neural signals
            <code>(<10 µVRMS )</code> while rejecting out-of-band noise, sample
            and digitize the amplified signals, and stream out the results for
            real-time processing—all using minimal power and size.
          </p>
          <p>
            The electronics are built around our custom Neuralink application
            specific integrated circuit (ASIC), which consists of 256
            individually programmable amplifiers (“analog pixels”), on-chip
            analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), and peripheral control
            circuitry for serializing the digitized outputs. The analog pixel is
            highly configurable: the gains and filter properties can be
            calibrated to account for variability in signal-quality due to
            process variations and the electrophysiological environment. The
            on-chip ADC samples at 19.3 kHz with 10 bit resolution. Each analog
            pixel consumes 5.2 µW and the whole ASIC consumes ∼6 mW, including
            the clock drivers. Performance of the Neuralink ASIC is summarized
            in table 1 and a photograph of the fabricated device is shown in
            fig. 5A.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Neuralink ASIC forms the core of a modular recording platform
            that allows for easy replacement of constitutive parts for research
            and development purposes (fig. 5). In the systems discussed here, a
            number of ASICs are integrated into a standard printed circuit board
            (PCB) using flip-chip integration. Each system consists of a
            field-programmable gate array (FPGA); real-time temperature,
            accelerometer, and magnetometer sensors; and a single USB-C
            connector for full-bandwidth data transfer. The systems are packaged
            in titanium cases which are coated with parylene-c, which serves as
            a moisture barrier to prevent fluid ingress and prolong functional
            lifetime.
          </p>
          <p>
            We describe two such configurations that we have built, a 1,536
            channel recording system (“System A”) and a 3,072 channel recording
            system (“System B”), summarized in table 2. While System A employs
            the current-generation Neuralink ASIC, System B uses an earlier
            revision with comparable functionality but poorer performance
            specifications. System B was designed to maximize channel density
            and is used for applications that demand extremely high channel
            count. In contrast, System A was designed to facilitate faster and
            more reliable manufacturing; it can be built five times faster than
            System B with better yields.

            An ethernet-connected base station converts the data streams from
            these systems into multicast 10G ethernet UDP packets allowing
            downstream users to process the data in a variety of ways, e.g.
            visualizing the data in real-time or writing it to disk. Each base
            station can connect to up to three implants simultaneously. These
            devices are further supported by a software ecosystem that allows
            for plug and play usability with zero configuration: neural data
            begins streaming automatically when a cable is connected.

            We have implanted both systems A and B in male Long-Evans rats, as
            described in section 3. All animal procedures were performed in
            accordance with the National Research Council’s Guide for the Care
            and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Neuralink
            Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Electrophysiological
            recordings were made as the animals freely explored an arena
            equipped with a commutated cable that permitted unrestricted
            movement. System A can record 1,344 out of 1,536 channels
            simultaneously, the exact channel configuration can be arbitrarily
            specified at the time of recording; system B can record from all
            3,072 channels simultaneously. Digitized broadband signals were
            processed in real-time to identify action potentials (spikes) using
            an online detection algorithm.

            Spike detection requirements for real-time BMI are different from
            most conventional neurophysiology. While most electrophysiologists
            spike-sort data offline and spend significant effort to reject
            false-positive spike events, BMI events must be detected in real
            time and spike detection parameters must maximize decoding efficacy.
            Using our custom online spike-detection software, we found that a
            permissive filter that allows an estimated false positive rate of
            ∼0.2 Hz performs better than setting stringent thresholds that may
            reject real spikes (data not shown).
          </p>
          <p>
            Given these considerations, we set a threshold of >0.35 Hz to
            quantify the number of electrodes that recorded spiking units. Since
            we typically do not spike sort our data, we do not report multiple
            units per channel. BMI decoders commonly operate without spike
            sorting with minimal loss of performance [35, 36]. Moreover, recent
            results show that spike sorting is not necessary to accurately
            estimate neural population dynamics [37].

            Data from a recent experiment using System A are shown in fig. 7 and
            fig. 8. In this experiment, 40 of 44 attempted insertions were
            successful (90 %) for a total of 1280 implanted electrodes, of which
            1,020 were recorded simultaneously. The broadband signals recorded
            from a representative thread show both local field and spiking
            activity fig. 7. A sample output of the spike detection pipeline is
            shown in raster form in fig. 8. In this example, two overlapping
            recording configurations were used to record from all 1,280
            implanted channels. On this array, our spiking yield was 53.4 % of
            channels, with many spikes appearing on multiple neighboring
            channels, as has been observed in other high-density probes [16, 17,
            21]. On other System A arrays we observed
            <code>59.10 ± 5.74 % (mean ± s.e.m.)</code> across 19 surgeries with
            a maximum spiking yield of 85.5 %.

            We have described a BMI with high-channel count and single-spike
            resolution. It is based on flexible polymer probes, a robotic
            insertion system, and custom low-power electronics. This system
            serves two main purposes: it is a research platform for use in
            rodents and serves as a prototype for future human clinical
            implants. The ability to quickly iterate designs and testing in
            rodents allows for the rapid refinement of devices, manufacturing
            processes, and software. Because it is a research platform, the
            system uses a wired connection to maximize the bandwidth for raw
            data streaming. This is important for performance assessments and
            crucial for the development of signal processing and decoding
            algorithms. In contrast, the clinical devices that will derive from
            this platform will be fully implantable—which requires hermetic
            packaging—and have on-board signal compression, reduced power
            consumption, wireless power transmission, and data telemetry through
            the skin without percutaneous leads.
          </p>
          <p>
            Modulating neural activity will be an important part of
            next-generation clinical brain-machine interfaces [38], for example
            to provide a sense of touch or proprioception to neuroprosthetic
            movement control [39, 40]. Therefore, we designed the Neuralink ASIC
            to be capable of electrical stimulation on every channel, although
            we have not demonstrated these capabilities here.
          </p>
          <p>
            This BMI system has several advantages over previous approaches. The
            size and composition of the thin-film probes are a better match for
            the material properties of brain tissue than commonly used silicon
            probes, and therefore may exhibit enhanced biocompatibility [28,
            21]. Also, the ability to choose where our probes are inserted,
            including into sub-cortical structures, allows us to create custom
            array geometries for targeting specific brain regions while avoiding
            vasculature. This feature is significant for creating a
            high-performance BMI, as the distribution of electrodes can be
            customized depending on the task requirements. Lastly, the
            miniturization and design of the Neuralink ASIC affords great
            flexibility in system design and supports very high channel counts
            within practical size and power constraints.
          </p>
          <p>
            In principle, our approach to brain-machine interfaces is highly
            extensible and scalable. Here we report simultaneous broadband
            recording from over 3,000 inserted electrodes in a freely moving
            rat. In a larger brain, multiple devices with this architecture
            could be readily implanted, and we could therefore interface with
            many more neurons without extensive re-engineering. Further
            development of surgical robotics could allow us to accomplish this
            without dramatically increasing surgery time.

            While significant technological challenges must be addressed before
            a high-bandwidth device is suitable for clinical application, with
            such a device, it is plausible to imagine that a patient with spinal
            cord injury could dexterously control a digital mouse and keyboard.
            When combined with rapidly improving spinal stimulation techniques
            [41], in the future this approach could conceivably restore motor
            function. High-bandwidth neural interfaces should enable a variety
            of novel therapeutic possibilities.
